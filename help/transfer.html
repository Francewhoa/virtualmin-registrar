<header>Transfer Domain Registration</header>

If this domain is currently registered with another registrar, you can
request for it to be transferred to one of your registrar accounts on this
page. The transfer does not happen instantaneously - it may take several
days, and require manual processes with the old registrar. <p>

Once the transfer is complete, you can use the <b>Import Domain Registration</b>
page to bring the domain under Virtualmin's control. <p>
