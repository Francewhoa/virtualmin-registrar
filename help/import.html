<header>Associate Domain Registration</header>

If you have already registered a domain manually with a registrar that
has been added on the DNS Domain Registrars page, you can use this form to 
tell Virtualmin about the registration. This allows it to de-register the
domain if you delete the virtual server, or attempt to modify the registration
if the domain name is changed. <p>

To use the form, first select the account you used from the
<b>Registered under account</b> menu. If you have an ID or registration code
for the domain, enter it in the <b>ID with registrar</b> field. Finally, if
you want the nameservers set at the registrar to be updated to match
this Virtualmin system, change <b>Update nameservers</b> to <b>Yes</b>. <p>
