<header>Automatic Domain Renewal</header>

In order to prevent domain registrations from lapsing when they expire,
Virtualmin can automatically renew them for you when they approach the
expiry date. To enable this feature, change the <b>Automatically renew domains close to expiry?</b> field to <b>Yes</b>, and enter the number of days before
expiry that each domain should be renewed. Something in the area of 30 days
is recommended, so that you have plenty of time to react if renewal fails. <p>

The period for which each domain is renewed can be set using the
<b>Years to renew for</b> field. By default, the initial registration
period set for this account will be used. <p>

If an email address is entered in the <b>Send renewal notification to</b>
field, a report listing all domains renewed each day will be send to it.
Any domains for which renewal failed due to an error from the registrar
will also be included. <p>
