<header>DNS Domain Registration</header>

The DNS Domain Registration plugin allows you to automate the process of
registering domains from within Virtualmin, rather than having to create
them manually. To do this, it needs to know the details of accounts that you
have with one or more registrars, in order to call their APIs to perform
the actual domain creation. <p>

This page lists the DNS registrar accounts that you have added to Virtualmin
for use when registering domain. To add a new registrar, select the company
from the <b>Add an existing account</b> menu at the bottom of the page and
click the <b>Start Adding</b> button. You must have at least one account
listed and active before you can register domains with Virtualmin.<p>

Accounts can also be enabled or disabled by selecting them using the checkboxes
on the left of the table and clicking the appropriate button. A registrar
account that is marked as disabled will not be used when registering new
domains. <p>
