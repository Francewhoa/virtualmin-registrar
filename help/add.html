<header>Add Registrar Account</header>

This page allows you to tell Virtualmin about a registrar account that you
have already setup, so that it can be used to register new domains. The most
important fields on the form are :

<ul>
<li><b>Account description</b><br>
    A short description to identify this account.
<li><b>Account login ID</b> and <b>Account password</b><br>
    The account authentication details provided by your registrar. These will
    be checked when the <b>Create</b> button is clicked.
<li><b>Top-level domains supported by registrar</b><br>
    Not an editable field, but a list of TLDs that this registrar can be used
    for.
<li><b>Additionally limit to top-level domains</b><br>
    If you want to limit this registrar account to creating domains under
    only a subset of the possible TLDs, enter them here. This can be useful
    if you have multiple accounts and some offer better prices than others
    on the same domain.
</ul>

When the <b>Create</b> button is clicked, the registrar's details will be
validated and then the account added to Virtualmin's list of usable
registrars.<p>
