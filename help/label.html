<header>Register DNS domain?</header>

When this option is enabled, the virtual server's DNS domain will be
registered with a registrar appropriate for it's top-level domain. This will
only work if the domain has not been registered by anyone else, and if the
DNS feature has been enabled for this virtual server. <p>
