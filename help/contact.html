<header>Edit Domain Contacts</header>

Every registered DNS domain has contact information associated with it, 
which is typically publicly available and can be displayed using Unix commands
like <tt>whois</tt>. This form allows you to edit the contacts for a
Virtualmin managed domain, of which there may be several depending on the
registrar. <p>

The exact contact information varies between registrars, but typically
you can enter the domain owner's name, company, address, phone number and
email address. A domain typically has an administrative contact (the person
who owns the domain), and a technical contact (the person responsible for
configuring it). Contacts after the first have a <b>Same as the first
contact?</b> field, which can be set to <b>Yes</b> if all contacts are
the same person. <p>
