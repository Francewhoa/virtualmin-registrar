<header>Create Registrar Account</header>

This page allows you to create a new account with a registrar, which will be
billed to your credit card or pre-paid balance. The exact details you need
to enter will differ between registrars, but in general you will need to
select a username and password, enter contact details, and credit card payment
information. <p>

Once the account is created, there may be a delay of several hours before it
can be used to register DNS domains for virtual servers. If creation fails for
some reason (such as an invalid credit card number), an error message will be
displayed immediately though. <p>
